    "question": "How can I use the HD client?",
    "answer": "Currently, the client is in closed beta, meaning only a limited amount of people may use it. We are seeking dedicated users that understand there will be some issues and not only take the time to report them but assist in reproducing and resolving them."
  },
  {
    "question": "Will this client have plugins like RuneLite?",
    "answer": "Yes. The priority of this project is to restore content as it was in 2008/2009.In this first phase, we will be completing the restore, and laying the foundation for future phases. We imagine people will want plugins before we begin working on new content. It is very possible we could turn this entire client into a plugin for RuneLite, but they will need to add more capabilities to support us. And we frankly doubt they would be willing to trust booting a external client. We're planning on simply mirroring RuneLite vs trying to maintain our own base. Plugins are not our objective, and it's best we focus on our goal, and delegate where we can."
  },
  {
    "question": "Will it have the plugins from their hub?",
    "answer": "There will be no external plugins to start, or possibly ever. If a plugin is deemed needed by the community, we could always add it."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is the client closed source?",
    "answer": "Due to methods used to communicate with servers we can assume Jagex would prefer our client be closed until they make contact with us. We are willing to provide binaries or information to anyone wishing to audit."
  },
  {
    "question": "Will I get banned for using this client?",
    "answer": "The safe answer is, we don’t know. So far, there have been no bans in over 5 months. We’re confident there will not be any, but the only way to know for sure is to have rigorous testing by our beta users."
  },
  {
    "question": "Have you contacted Jagex?",
    "answer": "Yes, sadly with no reply just yet."
  },
  {
    "question": "You’re using ‘stolen assets’ surely Jagex will shut this down like other HD clients? ",
    "answer": "The only other ‘HD’ client to get taken down to our knowledge was ‘OSHD’. We can only speculate but believe it was shut down due to the developers not willing to comply with Jagex and releasing their code to them. That project also communicated with Jagex servers in a different manner to ours which we believe resulted in a number of bans. At the end of the day, we’re working on this project, this question is based from assumptions, and nobody will know until Jagex get in touch."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is there a release date for HDOS?",
    "answer": "Not currently, we are in closed beta for testing. If all goes well, we are looking at mid 2021."
